// We will give you a list containing the height (in floors) of buildings belonging to a street, from east to west. A real estate agent would like you to write an algorithm that returns how many buildings on that street have at least one apartment with a view of the setting sun (to the west), in order to properly assess the value of the buildings on the street.

// For example, with the list [3, 7, 8, 3, 6, 1], the function should return 3, since the highest floor of buildings with size 8, 6, and 1 all have a view West. Or another example the list [1, 4, 5, 8] should return 1 since only the last building has at least one apartment with a view to the west.

// Exercise 2
// Solve subject 2 with an algorithmic complexity of O (nÂ²), ie your program will have to compare each element with each other using 2 nested loops.

const list = [3, 7, 8, 10, 3, 6, 1]
